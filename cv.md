### **About Me:**
I've liked programming since high school. 

When I was in the 11th grade of school, I did not know which university and what specialty to enroll in. 

I started learning HTML and CSS. I didn't study it deeply at that time, because it seemed to me that website builders(like lpgeneration, wix and etc) would displace web studios. After that, I was engaged in advertising for a couple of years. I had to take ready-made website templates and change data, pictures, text - this is how I practiced HTML and CSS.

When the coronavirus started in 2020, I got sick and realized that I didn't like what I was doing.
In 2021, I decided to start studying web development in more depth.

I want to become a strong developer and make cool projects
